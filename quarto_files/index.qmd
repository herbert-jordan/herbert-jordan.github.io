## About Me

Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado, Boulder in Eric Small's terrestrial hydrology lab. I use this website to share a little bit about myself and the science I'm working on. My current research uses models and statistical methods to address critical questions about water availability, with the goal of supporting water resource managers and policymakers in making informed decisions.

I enjoy solving problems with computational methods, wrangling big datasets, making pretty maps and figures, and emphasizing science with applications for society. When Iâ€™m not sitting behind a desk, I can be found biking, running, or skiing on the front range, baking a loaf of sourdough, or watching the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy (for the 17th time) with my cat Pippin.
