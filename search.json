I use this website to share a little bit about myself and the science I’m working on. My current research uses emerging technologies and statistical methods to address critical questions about water availability, with the goal of supporting water resource managers and policymakers in making informed decisions on water management and allocation.\nI enjoy solving problems with computational methods, wrangling big datasets, making pretty maps and figures, and emphasizing science with applications for society. When I’m not sitting behind a desk, I can be found biking, running, or skiing on the front range, baking a loaf of sourdough, or watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy (for the 17th time) with my cat Pippin."
