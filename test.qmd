## Welcome! 

Here, I hope to share a little bit about myself and my research. This website is a work in progress - I'm taking this as an opportunity to learn how to code a website myself.

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
import os
os.cpu_count()
```

```{python}


```




## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
